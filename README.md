ETCE
==

ETCE is the Extendable Test Control Environment, a Pure Python
framework for efficiently writing and running
[EMANE](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane) emulations. ETCE was
initially developed as Adjacent Link's internal tool for performing
EMANE regression tests. It's goals are to organize and automate the
mundane tasks of emulation:

* Controlling applications across distributed hosts
* Generating emulation definitions correctly, concisely and in a uniform format
* Collecting and organizing test outputs
